# Vowel Count

[https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ff3102c1bad923760001f3](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ff3102c1bad923760001f3)

DESCRIPTION:

- Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
- We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).
- The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

```py
def get_count(sentence):
    pass
```

### PYTHON SOLUTION:

```py
def get_count(sentence):
    return sum(1 for v in sentence if v in 'aeiou')
```

```py
def get_count(sentence):
    return sum(v in 'aeiou' for v in sentence)
```

```py
import re

def get_count(sentence):
    return len(re.findall('[aeiou]', sentence, re.IGNORECASE))

# Highest and Lowest

DESCRIPTION:

- In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Examples

- high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5")  # return "5 1"
- high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
- high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"

Notes

* All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
* There will always be at least one number in the input string.
* Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

```py
def high_and_low(numbers):
    # ...
    return numbers
```

### PYTHON SOLUTION:

```py
def high_and_low(numbers):
    list_nums = numbers.split(' ')
    sorted_nums = sorted(map(int, list_nums))
    return '{} {}'.format(sorted_nums[-1], sorted_nums[0])
```

```py
def high_and_low(numbers):
    list_num = [int(num) for num in numbers.split(' ')]
    return "{} {}".format(max(list_num), min(list_num))
```

```py
def high_and_low(numbers):
    list_num = [int(num) for num in numbers.split(' ')]
    return "%i %i" % (max(list_num),min(list_num))
```

DESCRIPTION:

- You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.
- Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20
- Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

```py

    return sum([n for n in arr if n > 0])
```

```py

DESCRIPTION:

- In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Examples

```py
make_negative(1);  # return -1
make_negative(-5); # return -5
make_negative(0);  # return 0
```

Notes
- The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
- Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

```py
def make_negative( number ):
    pass
```

### PYTHON SOLUTION:

```py
def make_negative( number ):
    return -number if number>0 else number
```

```py

DESCRIPTION:

Summation

- Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. 
- The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. 
- Your function only needs to return the result, what is shown between parentheses in the example below is how you reach that result and it's not part of it, see the sample tests.

For example (Input -> Output):

```x
2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)
```

```py
def summation(num):
    pass
```

### PYTHON SOLUTION:

```py
def summation(num):

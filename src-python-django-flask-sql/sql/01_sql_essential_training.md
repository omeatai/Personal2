# Accessing Data from multiple Tables - USING INNER JOINS

- An inner join only returns matching records.
- Any unmatched data from either table is ignored.
- Joins are often described with the use of Venn diagrams.
- As our Venn diagram shows, an inner join represents only the overlapping section of the Venn diagram.
-  The inner join is the most common type of join that's used.
-  The main use of the inner join is to bring corresponding data together from different tables in a relational database.

<summary>23. Accessing Data from multiple Tables - USING LEFT OUTER JOINS </summary>

# Accessing Data from multiple Tables - USING LEFT OUTER JOINS

- A left outer join combines all the records from the left table with any matching records from the right table.
- As shown in our Venn diagram, the concept of left table and right table depends entirely on the order these tables are listed in the join statement.
- So for example, our SQL statement here has listed invoices first. Then after the left outer join, it lists the customer table.
- Our invoice table is the left table and our customer table is the right table.
- With this type of join, everything in our invoice table will be displayed.
- Since customer 1 did not order any songs, that particular record is omitted.
- We are combining all 5 records from the invoice table with only 3 records from the customer table.
- Left joins are useful because they allow us to see discrepancies in our data.
- We can produce lists of customers that have not generated invoices or search for data that has been removed in the right table but still exist in the left.

# Accessing Data from multiple Tables - USING RIGHT OUTER JOINS

- The right outer joins are not supported in SQLITE.
- However, right joins are still very popular in other relational database management systems.
- The right outer join returns the entire right table as well as matching information from the left table.
- The right join is a mirror image of the left join, and functions in a very similar way.
- The right join takes all fields from the right table, in this case the customer's table, and matches that data with any corresponding data from the invoice table or the left table.

# SQL Functions -  DATE Functions - Calculate the ages of all employees

- We need to leverage the birth date field to calculate each employee's age. 
- We need to find out the difference between the current date and the employee's birthdate.
- We can employ a new date function which is called the strftime.
- The strftime function converts date and time strings into another format.
